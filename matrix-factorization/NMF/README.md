# Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

There exist many matrix decomposition methods for tackling machine learning problems, the most famous proabbly being PCA (SVD). Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is used in many ways but most notably for feature extraction. It requires the input vector to have all non-negative values.

## Data

Included in the data folder are the following sets:
1. __Ancient Hebrew__: This is a dataset of ancient and modern Hebrew with 18 different authors and for most characters in the Hebrew alphabet. This was used to author attribution for ancient texts found in and around 700 B.C.E. 
2. __faces__: The CBCL face database MIT Center For Biological and Computation Learning (2429 gray-level 19-by-19 pixels images). Test and Train sets that include both faces and non-faces of grayscale images. Nice dataset becasue the grayscale pixels are integers in the set {0,255}.
3. __conference_papers__: Dataset of papers contributed to a conference over a number of years. Find topics?
4. __blogs__: loads and loads of blogs form the early 2000's. One could try to determine age and gender based on text. 

Some of the data housed in the `data` subfolder has been zipped to conform with the GitHub size constraints. Be sure to unzip them in order to use.
